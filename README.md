Interoperability RFCs
=====================

This repository contains RFCs aimed at improving interoperability between
various services. It's useful to clarify that while some of these RFCs might be
motivated by particular project (e.g. Bitcoin), they are widely applicable. If
they were specific to particular project, they would be proposed at the project
repository instead (e.g. as BIPs).

Currently there's only `interface_files` accompanied with `interface_spec` RFC,
but I created this repository for other RFCs too. (I already have some ideas.)
